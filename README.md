# Analyzing Weld Composite Material and Mechanial properties using statistical / machine learning approaches

## Webscraping

### The data for this projects was obtained via webscraping welding materials data from the following sites

- [Certilas Welding Products Dataset](https://certilas.nl/en/catalogue)
- [Lincoln Electric Welding Products Dataset](https://www.lincolnelectric.com/en-us/consumables/Pages/consumables.aspx)
- [Citrination Weld Composites Dataset](https://citrination.com/datasets/114194/show_search?searchMatchOption=fuzzyMatch)

This scraping was done through the combination of webscraping and data preprocessing using BeautifulSoup and Pandas. See [my webscraping code to see exactly how I did that (sorry about the messiness)]()
