This hardness creates a tough, ductile, wear-, corrosion-, and high-temperature resistant surface. The hardness of 30% cold-worked wrought product is approximately RC50. -ULTIMET deposits exhibit extremely high resistance to metal to metal galling and seizing. -The pitting resistance of ULTIMET alloy in chloride solutions is equal to that of HASTELLOY C-22HS alloy, and is greater than that of C-276 alloy.",,917.0,, 0.020,0.05-1.0,,"•Valve component overlay •""Make/break"" seal welds in threades unions •Weld overlays to marine riser tensioners, shafts, and larger hydraulic systems pistons •Weld overlay to u-bends, piping and valves used in conveying sour crudes containing abrasives •Slurry, rock, and acid tumblers & mixers •Impellers •Fiberglass manufacturing",,654.0,654.0,,1.0-3.0,,

10 times faster than overlay welding by SMAW
No delution with the basemetal and a full 60 HRc in the total thickness of the plate
no excessive heat that effects the basemetal or cause loose in strength
two times faster to apply compare to big overlay welded plates
50% weight reduction on operating system compare to overlay welded plates
Manageable size (150x100x5mm), easy to transport and easy to apply in all positions
More conveniant for the welder and suitable for more applications
Can be replaced individually when needed and also cut by normal flame
pattern allows spaces between the plates and offer more wear resistance

It is especially suitable in many sulfuric, nitric, hydrochloric, and acetic acid applications. Backup Shielding. Backup shielding protects the molten root of the weld on the first pass and blankets the solidified weld during subsequent passes until the root surface temperature stays below 600 degrees F. Backup shielding also should be used on the back surface of sheet or plate less than 1/4 in. thick to prevent oxidation. Gas Requirements. Welding-grade argon (99.999 percent purity) usually is chosen for primary, secondary, and backup shielding, as well as for purging. Argon provides excellent arc stability, and because it is heavier than air, it blankets the weld and provides protection. Helium or argon/helium mixtures sometimes are used for torch shielding if added penetration is desired. Argon and helium mixtures also are occasionally employed for backup shielding and purging, in which helium's low density can effectively purge blind spaces. Gas Purity. Argon usually is purchased to 99.998 percent purity with a guarantee of less than 5 parts per million (PPM) oxygen, moisture, or total hydrocarbons. The dew point at the gas supply should not be more than -60 degrees F (-51 degrees C).",,55.0,30000.0,,,,"Welding Zirconium alloys in general but also for successfully weld zirconium to titanium, tantalum, niobium (columbium) and vanadium however the weld metal will be stringer and less ductile than the base metals.",,659.0,659.0,,,,
