{"1248":{"category":2.0,"name":"ERTi-1","Applications":"ERTi-1. Grade 1 is the lowest strength unalloyed (or Commercially Pure\u2014CP) grade. Grade 1 is used in applications where ductility is paramount, such as explosive cladding, loose linings, expanded metal, and deep drawing applications. It is also used in electrolytic applications like coated anode substrates for production of chlorine and sodium chlorate.","As":null,"C":0.03,"Cr":0.0,"Cu":0.0,"Diffusible Hydrogen":null,"Mn":0.0,"Mn + Ni + Cr + Mo + V":null,"Mo":0.0,"N":0.012,"Nb":0.0,"Ni":0.0,"Ni+Mn":null,"P":0.0,"P S":null,"S":0.0,"S Ni":null,"SN":null,"Si":0.0,"Si P":null,"Sn":0.0,"Suitable_For":"ER Ti-1 is the purest grade and is suitable for welding Titanium grade 1, 2, 3 and 4. With the restriction that the mechanical properties are much less than Grade 2, 3 and 4. The weld deposit is ductile and offers excellent corrosion resistance in oxidizing environments. This alloy finds his applications in chemical industry and offers excellent Weldabillity.","V":0.0,"conformances":null,"ind":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.ceweld.nl\/en\/product\/erti-1"}}
