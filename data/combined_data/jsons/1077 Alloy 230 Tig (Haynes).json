{"1077":{"category":2.0,"name":"Alloy 230 Tig (Haynes)","Applications":"Alloy 230 combines properties which make it ideally suited for a wide variety of component applications in the aerospace and power industries. It is used for combustion cans, transition ducts, flame holders, thermocouple sheaths, and other important gas turbine components. In the chemical process industry, 230 alloy is used for catalyst grid supports in ammonia burners, high-strength thermocouple protection tubes, high-temperature heat exchangers, ducts, high-temperature bellows, and various other key process internals. In the industrial heating industry, applications for 230 alloy include furnace retorts, chains and fixtures, burner flame shrouds, recuperator internals, dampers, nitriding furnace internals, heat-treating baskets, grates, trays, sparger tubes, thermocouple protection tubes, cyclone internals, and many more.","As":null,"C":0.1,"Cr":22.0,"Cu":0.0,"Diffusible Hydrogen":null,"Mn":0.5,"Mn + Ni + Cr + Mo + V":null,"Mo":2.0,"N":0.0,"Nb":0.5,"Ni":57.0,"Ni+Mn":null,"P":0.0,"P S":null,"S":0.0,"S Ni":null,"SN":null,"Si":0.4,"Si P":null,"Sn":0.0,"Suitable_For":"Haynes Alloy 230","V":0.0,"conformances":null,"ind":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.ceweld.nl\/en\/product\/alloy-230-tig-haynes"}}
