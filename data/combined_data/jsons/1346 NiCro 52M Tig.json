{"1346":{"category":2.0,"name":"NiCro 52M Tig","Applications":"Nicro 52M filler metal is used for welding nickel-chromium-iron (Inconel 690) alloys to themselves, and for dissimilar welding between nickel-chromium-iron alloys and steels or stainless steels. The applications include surfacing as well as clad-side welding. This product contains Boron and Zirconium to minize the tendency for ductility-dip cracking, while it is especially resistant to oxide \"floaters\" and inclusions.","As":null,"C":0.04,"Cr":29.75,"Cu":0.3,"Diffusible Hydrogen":null,"Mn":1.0,"Mn + Ni + Cr + Mo + V":null,"Mo":0.0,"N":0.014,"Nb":0.0,"Ni":57.136,"Ni+Mn":null,"P":0.0,"P S":null,"S":0.015,"S Ni":null,"SN":null,"Si":0.5,"Si P":null,"Sn":0.0,"Suitable_For":"Inconel 690, VDM Alloy 690, Nicrofer 6030 N, FM 52...","V":0.0,"conformances":null,"ind":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.ceweld.nl\/en\/product\/nicro-52m-tig"}}
