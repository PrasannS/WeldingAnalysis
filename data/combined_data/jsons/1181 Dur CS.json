{"1181":{"category":5.0,"name":"Dur CS","Applications":"The area to be hardfaced should be free of rust, scale, grease or other dirt. Slowly preheat the area to a maximum of 500\u00b0C (932\u00b0F). Sprinkle the surface with Ceweld Universal\u2013Flux to prevent oxides from forming in the molten matrix during application.Once the area is properly heated,start brazing with L-CuNi10ZnF tinning rods (about 1 mm layer). Now apply DUR-CS. To make brazing easier dip the end in the brazing flux. NOTE: Do not overheat the hardfaced area. Particles can be pushed in correct position and dense configuration by using the end of the tinning Rod. Slow cooling is advised. Never cool area with water!","As":null,"C":0.0,"Cr":0.0,"Cu":48.0,"Diffusible Hydrogen":null,"Mn":0.0,"Mn + Ni + Cr + Mo + V":null,"Mo":0.0,"N":0.0,"Nb":0.0,"Ni":10.0,"Ni+Mn":null,"P":0.0,"P S":null,"S":0.0,"S Ni":null,"SN":null,"Si":0.0,"Si P":null,"Sn":0.0,"Suitable_For":"Downhole reamers, openers, fishing tools (spears), coring tools, reamers, milling tools, overshots, stabilizers, steel sawing, concrete drilling.","V":0.0,"conformances":null,"ind":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.ceweld.nl\/en\/product\/dur-cs"}}
