{"1024":{"category":4.0,"name":"AA CrCoMo 46","Applications":"The characteristics of the deposit are comparable with cobalt-base alloys in terms of thermal shock and corrosion resistance that makes this alloy aplicable for overlaying parts that are subject to high temperatures combined with corrosion attack, wear and thermal shock combinations. AA CrCoMo 46 can be used as intermediate layer against metal to metal wear at high pressure loads.","As":null,"C":0.15,"Cr":15.0,"Cu":0.0,"Diffusible Hydrogen":null,"Mn":0.45,"Mn + Ni + Cr + Mo + V":null,"Mo":4.0,"N":0.0,"Nb":0.0,"Ni":0.6,"Ni+Mn":null,"P":0.0,"P S":null,"S":0.0,"S Ni":null,"SN":null,"Si":0.3,"Si P":null,"Sn":0.0,"Suitable_For":"Hot rolling parts for continuous casting, hotpress tools, pump parts, sleeves, mandrels, forging hammers, chemical and glas industry.","V":0.0,"conformances":null,"ind":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.ceweld.nl\/en\/product\/aa-crcomo-46"}}
