{"1121":{"category":2.0,"name":"CuAl5Ni2","Applications":"Low alloyed aluminum bronze, particularly suitable for joint welds on ferritic and austenitic steels. Good flowing properties with good cover groove, also suitable for joint welds on steels and copper. \nFor multiplayer welding on steels, pulsed arc welding is recommended. Amazing results are obtained on stainless steel sheet metal due to less heat input, higher travel speed and less cleaning hours. \nContainers, valve control chambers, exhaust parts, thin sheet welding (steel and specially stainless steel) Ship propellers, shipbuilding, pump building, shafts, guide grooves etc.\n\n\n","As":null,"C":0.0,"Cr":0.0,"Cu":93.15,"Diffusible Hydrogen":null,"Mn":0.3,"Mn + Ni + Cr + Mo + V":null,"Mo":0.0,"N":0.0,"Nb":0.0,"Ni":1.8,"Ni+Mn":null,"P":0.0,"P S":null,"S":0.0,"S Ni":null,"SN":null,"Si":0.0,"Si P":null,"Sn":0.0,"Suitable_For":null,"V":0.0,"conformances":null,"ind":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.ceweld.nl\/en\/product\/cual5ni2"}}
