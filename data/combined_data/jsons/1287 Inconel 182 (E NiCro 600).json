{"1287":{"category":3.0,"name":"Inconel 182 (E NiCro 600)","Applications":"Nicro 600 electrodes are used for welding of nickel-chromium-iron (Inconel 600, 601 and 690) alloys to themselves, and for dissimilar welding between nickel-chromium-iron (Monel, Inconel and incoloy) alloys and steels or stainless steels. The applications include surfacing as well as clad-side welding. High manganese of this weld deposit reduces the possibility of micro fissures. High manganese reduces creep strength, which limits its usage up to 900\u00b0F ","As":null,"C":0.1,"Cr":15.0,"Cu":0.5,"Diffusible Hydrogen":null,"Mn":7.25,"Mn + Ni + Cr + Mo + V":null,"Mo":0.0,"N":0.0,"Nb":1.75,"Ni":59.0,"Ni+Mn":null,"P":0.03,"P S":null,"S":0.015,"S Ni":null,"SN":null,"Si":1.0,"Si P":null,"Sn":0.0,"Suitable_For":"Dissimilar welds for which the electrode are used include INCONEL alloys and INCOLOY or Hastelloy alloys joined to carbon steels, stainless steels, nickel and MONEL alloys, MONEL alloys joined to carbon steels; nickel joined to stainless steels; and stainless steels joined to carbon steels.\nAlloy type : Incoloy 800, DS - Inconel 600, 601, UNS Nr (unified numbering system) : K 81340, N06600, N06601, N08800, N08810.
