{"1048":{"category":4.0,"name":"AA NiCro 600","Applications":" AA NICRO 600 is developed for welding and cladding nickel-based alloys such as alloy 600 or similar materials. This alloy can also be used for welding dissimilar nickel-based alloys to each other, to alloyed steels or to stainless steels. AA NICRO 600 can also be used on difficult to weld steels ! \n","As":null,"C":0.045,"Cr":21.0,"Cu":0.0,"Diffusible Hydrogen":null,"Mn":3.2,"Mn + Ni + Cr + Mo + V":null,"Mo":0.0,"N":0.0,"Nb":0.0,"Ni":70.0,"Ni+Mn":null,"P":0.0,"P S":null,"S":0.0,"S Ni":null,"SN":null,"Si":0.3,"Si P":null,"Sn":0.0,"Suitable_For":"Alloy type : Incoloy 800, DS - Inconel 600, 601, UNS Nr (unified numbering system) : K 81340, N06600, N 06601, N 08800, N 08810.
