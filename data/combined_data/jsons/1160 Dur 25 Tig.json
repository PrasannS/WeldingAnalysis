{"1160":{"category":2.0,"name":"Dur 25 Tig","Applications":"Dur 25 combines properties which make it suitable for a number of component applications in the aerospace industry, including parts in established military and commercial gas turbine engines. In modern engines, it has largely been replaced by newer materials such as 188 alloy, and, most recently, 230\u00ae alloy, which possess improved properties. Another area of significant usage for Dur 25 is as a bearing material, for both balls and races.","As":null,"C":0.1,"Cr":20.0,"Cu":0.0,"Diffusible Hydrogen":null,"Mn":1.5,"Mn + Ni + Cr + Mo + V":null,"Mo":1.0,"N":0.0,"Nb":0.0,"Ni":10.0,"Ni+Mn":null,"P":0.0,"P S":null,"S":0.0,"S Ni":null,"SN":null,"Si":0.4,"Si P":null,"Sn":0.0,"Suitable_For":"Wear problems at high temperatures in case high strength is required.","V":0.0,"conformances":null,"ind":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.ceweld.nl\/en\/product\/dur-25-tig"}}
