{"1306":{"category":2.0,"name":"317L","Applications":"For welding stabilized and un-stabilized CrNiMo(N) type of steels with high corrosion resistance. Also suitable for dissimilar welds between steel and stainless steel or dissimilar stainless steels. 317L has good resistance to general corrosion and pitting due to its high content of molybdenum. The alloy has a low carbon content which makes it particularly recommended when there is a risk of intergranular corrosion. The alloy is used in severe corrosion conditions such as in the petrochemical, pulp, cotton and paper industries.\n","As":null,"C":0.03,"Cr":18.5,"Cu":0.0,"Diffusible Hydrogen":null,"Mn":3.5,"Mn + Ni + Cr + Mo + V":null,"Mo":4.5,"N":0.12,"Nb":0.0,"Ni":13.5,"Ni+Mn":null,"P":0.0,"P S":null,"S":0.0,"S Ni":null,"SN":null,"Si":0.3,"Si P":null,"Sn":0.0,"Suitable_For":"1.4439, 1.4429, 1.4438, 1.4583, X2CrNiMoN 17 13 5, X2CrNiMoN 17 13 3, X2CrNiMo 18 15 4, X10CrNiMoNb 18 12, 317LN, (TP)316LN, 317L, non magnetic, ferrite free.","V":0.0,"conformances":null,"ind":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.ceweld.nl\/en\/product\/317l"}}
