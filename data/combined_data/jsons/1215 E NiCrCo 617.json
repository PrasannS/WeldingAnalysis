{"1215":{"category":3.0,"name":"E NiCrCo 617","Applications":"NiCrCo 617 is a covered electrode which is used for welding of nickel-chromium-cobalt-molybdenum alloys (UNS Number N06617). This electrode can also be used for overlay cladding where similar alloy is required. Weld metal provides optimum strength and oxidation resistance above 1500\u00b0up to 2100\u00b0F, especially when welding on base metals of nickel-iron-chromium alloys.
