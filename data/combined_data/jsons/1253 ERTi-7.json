The 0.12 wt% palladium addition improves corrosion performance under mildly reducing conditions or where crevice or under-deposit corrosion is a problem. ERTi-7 can be considered for welding Grade 2 or 16 where improved corrosion performance is desired.","As":null,"C":0.03,"Cr":0.0,"Cu":0.0,"Diffusible Hydrogen":null,"Mn":0.0,"Mn + Ni + Cr + Mo + V":null,"Mo":0.0,"N":0.015,"Nb":0.0,"Ni":0.0,"Ni+Mn":null,"P":0.0,"P S":null,"S":0.0,"S Ni":null,"SN":null,"Si":0.0,"Si P":null,"Sn":0.0,"Suitable_For":"Titanium grade 7, Grade 2, Grade 16","V":0.0,"conformances":null,"ind":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.ceweld.nl\/en\/product\/erti-7"}}
