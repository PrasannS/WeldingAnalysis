{"1415":{"category":4.0,"name":"OA WC2 Ni","Applications":"This Ni-based alloy provides an excellent corrosion resistance combined with extreme abrasion resistance. OA WC2 (Ni) can be applied on all sorts of steels except on cast iron or Mn-steel. This alloy is the most wear resistant type in most hardfacing applications. In case of very fine dust abrasion It might happen that the matrix will be washed out and looses the imbedded Tungsten carbides, in this case another hardfacing product should be considdered.","As":null,"C":0.0,"Cr":0.0,"Cu":0.0,"Diffusible Hydrogen":null,"Mn":0.0,"Mn + Ni + Cr + Mo + V":null,"Mo":0.0,"N":0.0,"Nb":0.0,"Ni":0.0,"Ni+Mn":null,"P":0.0,"P S":null,"S":0.0,"S Ni":null,"SN":null,"Si":0.0,"Si P":null,"Sn":0.0,"Suitable_For":"Rebuilding of stabilisers and other oilfield tools where maximum protection is required.
