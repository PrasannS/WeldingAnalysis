{"1469":{"category":9.0,"name":"SA Nicro 625","Applications":"SA Nicro 625 is developed for welding and cladding nickel-based alloys such as alloy 625 or similar materials. This alloy can also be used for welding dissimilar nickel-based alloys to each other, to alloyed steels or to stainless steels and for joining 6% molybdenum super austenitic steels.. SA Nicro 625 is most commonly used in the chemical processing industry, pollution control equipment, marine equipment, nuclear reactor components, pump shafts. Also used in the aerospace industry for thrust reverser assemblies, fuel nozzles, after-burners and combustion systems.","As":null,"C":0.04,"Cr":21.25,"Cu":0.0,"Diffusible Hydrogen":null,"Mn":0.5,"Mn + Ni + Cr + Mo + V":null,"Mo":9.0,"N":0.0,"Nb":0.0,"Ni":63.86,"Ni+Mn":null,"P":0.0,"P S":null,"S":0.0,"S Ni":null,"SN":null,"Si":0.6,"Si P":null,"Sn":0.0,"Suitable_For":"Nicro 625 is developed for welding and cladding nickel-based alloys such as alloy 625, 825\u00a0or similar materials.
