{"1537":{"category":12.0,"name":"SP 80\/20 NiCr","Applications":"Ceweld SP 80\/20 is a nickel-chromium electrical-resistance alloy for use at operating \n                       temperatures up to 2100\u00b0F (1150\u00b0C). It contains rare-earth additions for increased \n                       oxidation resistance, especially under conditions of frequent switching or wide \n                       temperature fluctuations. The alloy has a low temperature coefficient of resistance, \n                       making it suitable for control resistors. Used for heating elements in domestic \n                       appliances and industrial equipment. Excellently suitable as a buffer layer before \n                       finishing with ceramic layers. \n","As":null,"C":0.15,"Cr":20.0,"Cu":0.0,"Diffusible Hydrogen":null,"Mn":1.0,"Mn + Ni + Cr + Mo + V":null,"Mo":0.0,"N":0.0,"Nb":0.0,"Ni":0.0,"Ni+Mn":null,"P":0.0,"P S":null,"S":0.01,"S Ni":null,"SN":null,"Si":1.25,"Si P":null,"Sn":0.0,"Suitable_For":"NiCr metal spray wire for heat resistant coatings with excelent bonding strenght.","V":0.0,"conformances":null,"ind":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.ceweld.nl\/en\/product\/sp-8020-nicr"}}
