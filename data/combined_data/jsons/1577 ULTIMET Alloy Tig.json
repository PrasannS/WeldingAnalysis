{"1577":{"category":2.0,"name":"ULTIMET Alloy Tig","Applications":"Wire can be used to weld ULTIMET wrought products and to overlay and clad carbon and low-alloy steels. The weld deposits harden very quickly by cold working. In addition, it is very easy to deposit a \"crack-free\" layer without a butter layer. The filler metal finish on the MIG wire is for a smooth feeding through welding equipment and reduces tip wear in contact tips.","As":null,"C":0.06,"Cr":25.5,"Cu":0.0,"Diffusible Hydrogen":null,"Mn":0.8,"Mn + Ni + Cr + Mo + V":null,"Mo":5.0,"N":0.075,"Nb":0.0,"Ni":9.0,"Ni+Mn":null,"P":0.03,"P S":null,"S":0.02,"S Ni":null,"SN":null,"Si":0.525,"Si P":null,"Sn":0.0,"Suitable_For":"\u2022Valve component overlay \u2022\"Make\/break\" seal welds in threades unions \u2022Weld overlays to marine riser tensioners, shafts, and larger hydraulic systems pistons \u2022Weld overlay to u-bends, piping and valves used in conveying sour crudes containing abrasives \u2022Slurry, rock, and acid tumblers & mixers \u2022Impellers \u2022Fiberglass manufacturing","V":0.0,"conformances":null,"ind":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.ceweld.nl\/en\/product\/ultimet-alloy-tig"}}
