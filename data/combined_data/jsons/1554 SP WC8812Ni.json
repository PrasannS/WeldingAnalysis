{"1554":{"category":7.0,"name":"SP WC8812Ni","Applications":"carbide powder for wear resistant coatings produced by flame-, plasma or hig hvelocity- flame-spraying (HVOF). Tungsten-Carbide-Nickel-coatings are resistant to abrasion and oxidation. In comparison with WC-Co layers they show an improved corrosion resistance in aqueous solutions. Plasma sprayed coatings can achieve a hardness of up to 1000 HV0.1 and tensile strength acc. to DIN 50160 of 60 N\/mm\u00b2. The maximum operating temperature is 750\u00b0C.","As":null,"C":12.0,"Cr":0.0,"Cu":0.0,"Diffusible Hydrogen":null,"Mn":88.0,"Mn + Ni + Cr + Mo + V":null,"Mo":0.0,"N":0.0,"Nb":0.0,"Ni":0.0,"Ni+Mn":null,"P":0.0,"P S":null,"S":0.0,"S Ni":null,"SN":null,"Si":0.0,"Si P":null,"Sn":0.0,"Suitable_For":"Augers, impellors, shafts, hydraulics, pulling equipment, fan blades etc.","V":0.0,"conformances":null,"ind":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.ceweld.nl\/en\/product\/sp-wc8812ni"}}
