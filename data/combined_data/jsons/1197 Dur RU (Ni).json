{"1197":{"category":3.0,"name":"Dur RU (Ni)","Applications":"The main applications are hardfacing and rebuilding of stabilisers and other oilfield tools where maximum protection is required. Also for augers, impellers, mixer plates in the brick and clay industry and on decanter screws in the food and chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed. DUR RU (Ni) can be applied on all sorts of steels except on cast iron or Mn-steel. This alloy is the most wear resistant type in most hardfacing applications. In case of very fine dust abrasion It might happen that the matrix will be washed out and looses the imbedded Tungsten carbides, in this case another hardfacing product should be considdered..","As":null,"C":0.0,"Cr":0.0,"Cu":0.0,"Diffusible Hydrogen":null,"Mn":0.0,"Mn + Ni + Cr + Mo + V":null,"Mo":0.0,"N":0.0,"Nb":0.0,"Ni":0.0,"Ni+Mn":null,"P":0.0,"P S":null,"S":0.0,"S Ni":null,"SN":null,"Si":0.0,"Si P":null,"Sn":0.0,"Suitable_For":"Scratchers, mixers, deep drilling, bentonit mixers, cement mixers, stabilisers, impellers, augers etc.","V":0.0,"conformances":null,"ind":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.ceweld.nl\/en\/product\/dur-ru-ni"}}
